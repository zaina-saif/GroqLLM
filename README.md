# PDF Parsing Chatbot with Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Welcome to the **PDF Parsing Chatbot** repository, developed as a final internship project at **Netlink**. This project features a custom chatbot that integrates advanced language modeling and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver precise responses to user queries based on PDF documents.

## Project Overview

The PDF Parsing Chatbot uses **OpenAI** and **LangChain** for intelligent data retrieval and query handling from PDF documents. It incorporates **Groq (Llama3)** for high-performance language modeling, allowing complex, multi-layered queries.

## Features

- **Advanced Language Modeling**: Utilizes **Groq (Llama3)** for handling complex language queries with contextual understanding.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrates a RAG pipeline, leveraging **LangChain** for efficient document retrieval and generating precise responses.
- **PDF Data Extraction and Parsing**: Extracts structured text, tables, and metadata from PDF files.
- **Natural Language Query Processing**: Allows users to ask specific questions about the PDF, with accurate retrieval of relevant data points.
- **Enhanced Data Retrieval**: Optimized with refined algorithms for faster and more accurate responses, achieving a 40% improvement in data retrieval efficiency.
- **Real-Time Query Interface**: Provides a smooth chat interface for querying PDF documents.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend programming language.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers language generation and natural language understanding.
- **LangChain**: Facilitates document processing, indexing, and integration with RAG pipelines.
- **Groq (Llama3)**: Advanced language model for robust query handling and contextual responses.
- **Groq Python API**: Used to explore model capabilities and enhance RAG.
- **PDF Parsing Libraries**: Libraries such as `PyMuPDF`, `pdfminer.six`, or `pdfplumber` for PDF extraction.
- **OCR**: `Tesseract` OCR for text extraction from scanned documents.
- **FastAPI**: Web framework to serve chatbot as a REST API.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-parsing-chatbot.git
   cd pdf-parsing-chatbot
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure OCR and PDF Parsing**:
   Ensure `Tesseract OCR` is installed and added to your PATH.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Access the Chatbot**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF**: Start by uploading a PDF document via the chatbot interface or API endpoint.
2. **Query the Chatbot**: Ask the chatbot specific questions about the PDF content. Examples:
   - "What are the main financial statistics?"
   - "List all sections related to employee benefits."
3. **Receive Responses**: The chatbot parses and retrieves information using RAG, Groq, and LangChain for accurate answers.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /upload_pdf**: Upload a PDF for parsing.
- **POST /query**: Send a query to the chatbot about the uploaded PDF.

## Future Improvements

- **Extended RAG Capabilities**: Expand retrieval algorithms to handle more complex documents.
- **Scalable Multi-Document Support**: Allow simultaneous parsing of multiple PDFs.
- **Improved NLP for Complex Queries**: Enhance chatbot’s language model to better interpret nuanced questions.
